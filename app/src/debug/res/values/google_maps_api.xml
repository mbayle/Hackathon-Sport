    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    BA:27:F4:D2:88:1A:07:08:C5:DB:40:7D:CF:C5:C2:CF:FF:B2:51:30

    SHA-1 certificate fingerprint:
    BA:27:F4:D2:88:1A:07:08:C5:DB:40:7D:CF:C5:C2:CF:FF:B2:51:30

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
